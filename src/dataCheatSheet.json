Please follow the steps below to register without a subscription:\n\nIf these email addresses are Gmail or Office 365, sign up here for a free trial! You can run the whole trial, or skip right to the pricing page. You will be prompted to purchase a plan, but instead click on \"not interested\" where you will be directed to extend your trial. Please make sure you accept the 14-day trial, and we will do the rest behind the scenes! If you are using Outlook for desktop for any of the emails you are interested in registering, you can do so directly through this link by installing the Outlook plugin!\n\nOnce you do so, I'll be able to manually upgrade your new account to reflect your existing subscription.\n\nLet me know once you complete this step!\n",

A coworker with whom you constantly correspond with falls into the \"trusted\" category (as we detect an actual response on your end) whereas spam and other junk gets put in the \"not trusted\" category, particularly after sending you multiple solicitations with no response.\nThus, in the case of Scott Tarbet, it is likely he has not yet been confirmed as \"trusted\" because there is no back-and-forth correspondence with this email address of his yet.
